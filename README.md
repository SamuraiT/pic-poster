Description
------------
This is a twitter bot that will post pictures and is supposed being used in an event.

Note
-----
`settings-sample.py` is literally a sample so it doesn't not contain
settings you need for tweeting.

Create a file called `settings.py` and fill out the missing
fields.
This file should not be added to source control. It should be in `.gitignore` file.

How to use
----------
This porject is still in development.
After finishing it, I will write here how to use.
